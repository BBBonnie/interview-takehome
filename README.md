## How to Write the Question:
For this interview take-home project, we would like you to fill in the functions listed in questions.ts.
Take generateSixDigitRandomNumberString() as an example. This function should generate a random six-digit number and return it as a string.

When writing the question, keep the following considerations in mind:

Clarity: The question should be clear and concise. Make sure that the student understands what is expected of them and what they need to accomplish.

Robustness: The function should be able to handle unexpected inputs and edge cases. Consider what happens if the input is not a number, or if the function is called with no arguments.

Ductility: The function should be flexible and able to be used in a variety of contexts. Consider what happens if the function is called multiple times in a row or if it needs to be used in a larger application.

Here is an example of what the function should look like:
```
export const generateSixDigitRandomNumberString = (): string => {
  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 900000) + 100000;
  return `${randomNumber}`;
}
```
